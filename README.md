Hello World!

This is my first time ever experience with GitHub, so i'm currently doing the "Hello World" GitHub Guide.

My name is Matheus and my nickname goes as araggohnxd. I'm from Brazil and recently discovered my passion for technology and coding.
I'm attending to an  HTML and CSS course, and one of the challenges were to host the page i'm creating to GitHub Pages, and I have absolutely no idea of how to do it.
Hope I manage to do it as soon as I finish this guide.

This is it for now.
Bye!
